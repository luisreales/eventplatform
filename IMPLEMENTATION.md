# Event Platform Implementation Overview

## Architecture Overview
The Event Platform is built using a modern web architecture with a clear separation between backend and frontend services. The system follows clean architecture principles and uses a RESTful API for communication between layers.

## Backend Implementation (.NET Core Web API)

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: .NET Core Web API
- **Database**: SQLite (for development and testing)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with the following layers:
  - Domain Layer: Contains business entities and interfaces
  - Application Layer: Contains business logic and use cases
  - Infrastructure Layer: Implements data persistence and external services
  - API Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses

### Key Components
1. **Event Model**
   - Properties: Id, Title, DateTime, Location, Description, Status
   - Status Enum: Upcoming, Attending, Maybe, Declined
   - Data validation using attributes

2. **Data Persistence**
   - Entity Framework Core for ORM
   - SQLite database for data storage
   - Repository pattern for data access abstraction

3. **API Endpoints**
   - CRUD operations for events
   - RESTful endpoints following best practices
   - Proper error handling and status codes

## Frontend Implementation (Angular)

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Angular (Latest version)
- **UI Components**: Angular Material
- **State Management**: Services with RxJS
- **Routing**: Angular Router

### Key Components
1. **Event Management**
   - Event List Component: Displays all events in a table format
   - Event Form Component: Handles creation and editing of events
   - Event Service: Manages API communication

2. **User Interface**
   - Material Design components
   - Responsive layout
   - Form validation
   - Date picker integration

3. **Data Flow**
   - Service-based architecture
   - Reactive forms for data handling
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

## Communication Flow
1. Frontend makes HTTP requests to backend API
2. Backend processes requests through controllers
3. Business logic is handled in the application layer
4. Data is persisted through the infrastructure layer
5. Responses are sent back to the frontend
6. Frontend updates UI based on responses

## Security Considerations
- Input validation on both frontend and backend
- Proper error handling and logging
- CORS configuration for API access
- Data sanitization

## Development Workflow
1. Backend development using Visual Studio or VS Code
2. Frontend development using Angular CLI
3. API testing using tools like Postman
4. Version control using Git
5. Continuous integration/deployment setup

## Future Improvements
1. Authentication and Authorization
2. Real-time updates using SignalR
3. File upload for event images
4. Advanced search and filtering
5. User roles and permissions
6. Email notifications
7. Calendar integration
